# jsPsychBackendDemo
A simple Node.js @ Heroku demo for deploying <a href = "https://github.com/jodeleeuw/jsPsych/">jsPsych</a> experiments (for free!)

You can access the <a href = "https://floating-oasis-6903.herokuapp.com" target = "new"> live demo</a> on heroku, or read the series of tutorials on how to node-ify (sorry, couldn't resist) your experiments on <a href = "http://web-psychometrics.com/tutorial1.html" target = "new">my website</a>.

If you wish to follow along, clone the <a href = "https://github.com/Tuuleh/jsPsychBackendStart">starting repository</a> with the basic layout and follow the tutorial series.
