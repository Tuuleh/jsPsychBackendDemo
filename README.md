# jsPsychBackendDemo
A simple node.js @ Heroku demo for deploying jsPsych experiments (for free!) 
You can access the live demo on <a href = "https://floating-oasis-6903.herokuapp.com" target = "new">heroku</a>, or read the series of tutorials on how to node-ify (sorry, couldn't resist) your experiments on <a href = "http://web-psychometrics.com/tutorial1.html" target = "new">my website</a>.
